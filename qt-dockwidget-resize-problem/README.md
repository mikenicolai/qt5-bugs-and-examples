qt-dockwidget-resize-problem
=============================l


The resize function is not working properly when having dock widgets. I guess if you think about it, it makes no sense to resize a dockwidget, because
it depends when it is docked at least in one direction. However, you can adjust the sizes following the example in the folder.


The examples was taken from here:
